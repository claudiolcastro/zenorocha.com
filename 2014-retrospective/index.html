          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Jan 04, 2015</h2>

        <p>I love this part of the year, after all a new year is a new beginning, right?</p>
<p>It&#39;s now a tradition: every year I try to list the things I&#39;ve done (<a href="http://zenorocha.com/entao-e-natal-e-ano-novo-tambem/">2011</a>, <a href="http://zenorocha.com/my-way/">2012</a>, <a href="http://zenorocha.com/o-que-eu-espero-para-2014/">2013</a>), this is a reminder to identify what decisions worked well and what was a disaster. For me, it&#39;s also the time to ask myself: &quot;Where do I wanna get in my career?&quot; and after some thought into that comes the second question: &quot;What am I doing right now to achieve that?&quot;</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>2014 was the year when I officially made the shift towards a Developer Advocate career. I&#39;ve been doing that for the past years but now it&#39;s official. Because of that, this year&#39;s selfish retrospective is going to be focused in the highlights and some numbers related to that.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2014-talks">Talks</h2>

<p>A very important part of my job (and probably the one I most love to do) is to travel and talk to developers. I&#39;m not gonna lie to you, standing in front of hundreds of people is still pretty scary but the feeling you get after a talk is so rewarding that you just can&#39;t stop doing it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying more to measure the impact of everything I do. One important addition to the <em>always-up-to-date</em> list of presentations found at <a href="http://zenorocha.com/talks">zenorocha.com/talks</a> is the approximate number of attendees for each event. I&#39;m also gathering social media feedbacks using <a href="http://storify.com/zenorocha/">Storify</a>, that way all your lovely post-talk tweets will be saved for my future kids to see.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>Since 2014 was the Web Component year for me, I can only choose a talk about that same topic. Presented in San Francisco on April, <em>&#39;Web Components: a chance to create the future&#39;</em> was the shortest but most impactul talk I gave this year both in quantitative and qualitative terms. A 14-minute video with almost 10 thousand views on YouTube so far.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this year was to explore more places. Although all these long hour flights demand a lot of energy, I feel extremely lucky to be able to experience so many cities with so many different people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2012:</strong> 24 talks. 13 cities in 3 different countries.</li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> 18 talks and 3 workshops. 12 cities in 3 different countries.</li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> 21 talks and 4 workshops. 18 cities in 8 different countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/posts/stats-2014-talks-map.jpg" alt="Graph: Talks per location"></p>
<p>For obvious reasons, I also wanted to give more talks in English rather than Portuguese and I&#39;m happy to see this plan going pretty well too.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/stats-2014-talks-per-language.jpg" alt="Graph: Talks per language"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2014-blogposts">Blogposts</h2>

<p>Along the years I started to write more in other blogs than in my own site. I like the idea of collaborating to higher audience channels and I&#39;ll keep doing that. My plan for 2015 is to use this site as a hub to the content I produce elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>My favorite blogpost this year was written in Portuguese and is called <a href="https://medium.com/@zenorocha/ser-popular-e-uma-merda-b739836e4407">&quot;Ser popular é uma merda&quot;</a>. It was something that I had to get off my chest about how being popular sucks, however even with all the exposure and bad judgment that people make about you it still worth it somehow.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/stats-2014-post-highlight.png" alt="Post: Ser popular é uma merda"></p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<p>I must admit, this year I spent more time consuming written content than actually producing it. Amazon and its goddamn Kindle are probably the main responsible for that, I just love buying and reading stuff there. Anyway, it&#39;s time to get back to writing, don&#39;t you think?</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/stats-2014-posts-per-blog.jpg" alt="Graph: Posts per blog"></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2014-podcasts">Podcasts</h2>

<p>Since 2012, I&#39;ve been hosting the <a href="http://zofe.com.br/">Zone Of Front-Enders</a> podcast along with <a href="https://twitter.com/danielfilho">Daniel Filho</a>. It&#39;s been an amazing journey, really. I got to know some incredible people and we were able to bring a lot of good discussions to our audience.</p>
<p>As some of you may know, I took the decision to leave the podcast some weeks ago. It wasn&#39;t easy but some personal reasons led me to believe that it was the best thing to do.</p>
<p>When we first started, there were no podcasts about front-end development stuff in Brazil. Now, when I see projects like <a href="http://www.codetalks.net/">CodeTalks</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZmp5CT7ASVdDkRZMzptLFw">Update Sem Where</a>, I feel like my mission is finally accomplished.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>For me the best episode in 2014 was <a href="http://zofe.com.br/posts/tcheretche-tcheretche-tcheretche-tchetche/">ZOFE #17</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/millermedeiros">Miller Medeiros</a> and the reason why I choose this one is very simple: we recorded it in the very same room in São Paulo.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/stats-2014-zofe-17.jpg" alt="ZOFE #17"></p>
<p>Still, nothing can be compared by the joy we had in the day before <a href="http://braziljs.com.br/">BrazilJS Conf</a>. This <a href="http://www.eventick.com.br/encontro-zofe-2014">little event</a> in Porto Alegre to get together some ZOFE fans was one of the most special moments I had in my entire year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Personal Contact: the richest experience, not matched by any media or technology</em> &mdash; <a href="http://smallactsmanifesto.org/">Small Acts Manifesto</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<p>Truth be told, we didn&#39;t dedicate as much time as we wanted for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2012:</strong> 4 episodes</li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> 8 episodes</li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> 8 episodes and 2 interviews (<a href="http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/the-web-components-community-helpful-resources">The Web Platform Podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.revistacliche.com.br/2014/10/clichecast38-web-e-design/">ClicheCast</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I might disappoint some people by leaving the podcast, I&#39;m excited to see what <a href="https://twitter.com/almirfilho">Almir Filho</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/caio_gondim">Caio Gondim</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaelrinaldi">Rafael Rinaldi</a> will come up for the new <a href="http://danielfilho.github.io/2014/12/18/zofe-2-0/">ZOFE 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of you wearing our t-shirts and showing our stickers in your computers everyday.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2014-projects">Projects</h2>

<p>I&#39;m really afraid of becoming those kind of people that only talks but don&#39;t do anything. That&#39;s why I try to keep my <a href="https://github.com/zenorocha">GitHub profile</a> pretty active by contributing to many different projects.</p>
<p>One of the things I liked about last year was that I got more in contact with organizations that I&#39;m a big fan of such as <a href="https://github.com/h5bp">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yeoman">Yeoman</a>. There&#39;s a lot to learn from every single person in those orgs.</p>

<p>I know that GitHub stars doesn&#39;t mean anything but since open source projects are really hard to measure let&#39;s use this.</p>

<li><a href="http://trackingjs.com">Tracking.JS</a>: <strong>2,411</strong> stars on GitHub</li>

</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2014-videos">Videos</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of video format for technology learning content because it gets outdated really quickly. Even so, I still do some tutorials and a couple of my talks are recorded as well. That&#39;s why I&#39;m putting everything on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zno14/featured">YouTube channel</a> now in a much more organized way.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>One of the nice things about being a <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/">Google Developer Expert</a> is that you have access to the whole company infrastructure, including a studio.</p>
<p>Because of that, we had this idea to create a video series about <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chrome DevTools</a> in Portuguese. This project was by far one of the things that consumed more energy in a short period of time. I had to create the whole content by myself in a week and we took a whole day to record it.</p>
