        <p><a href="/apresentando-wedeploy">*Read in Portuguese</a>*</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*W529TFRIga0fGFra4v29kw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two years ago <a href="https://twitter.com/eduardolundgren">Eduardo</a> and I decided to start something new.</p>
<p>At that time, we had built some popular libraries together and we thought we could try something more ambitious.</p>
<p>We didn’t know exactly what would that be, but we had a vision. We wanted to <strong>create something that would make developers more productive.</strong></p>
<p>The thing is, we didn’t want to leave <a href="https://www.liferay.com">Liferay</a> to pursue that vision, so we started to stay until late at the office and work on a prototype.</p>
<p>That prototype was called <em>Launchpad</em>, we showed it to some people internally and gained support to work more on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*r4tqGjg_7Ub7I4XDdAq1dA.png" alt="Launchpad Developer Preview (2015)"></p>
<p>Few months later we validated with real users and we noticed that there were many pieces missing. The result was not what we were looking for.</p>
<p>So we sat down again, now with a more clear goal in mind. We came up with new features, new interface, and new branding.</p>
<p>We launched the first alpha version last year. We showed it at few exclusive Liferay conferences and got more than 1,000 users. Things were getting real.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*_SKGU-tsAOoRf6Sz8cgUcw.png" alt="Presenting WeDeploy Alpha at Liferay DevCon (Germany, 2016)"></p>
<p>Today we’re finally launching the beta version. Until now we were quiet about it, but now I can finally share publicly what I’ve been working on.</p>
<p><strong>Without further ado, I present you <a href="https://wedeploy.com">WeDeploy</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We want developers to dedicate their time to what really matters: building awesome apps. That&#39;s why we’re so excited for you to try this new platform.</p>
<p>You can use it in many different ways. You can deploy a <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-nodejs/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-ruby/">Ruby</a> or <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-java/">Java</a> app. You can deploy static files (think of GitHub Pages but faster). You can deploy a <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-docker/">Dockerfile</a> and we automatically build it for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4DVTd-3dBs7qVClDsVEYfQ.gif" alt="An example of Wordpress and MySQL database on WeDeploy"></p>
<p>You can also deploy and use one of our services like <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/auth/getting-started/">WeDeploy Auth</a> to authenticate users, <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/data/getting-started/">WeDeploy Data</a> to save and consume data in real-time, and <a href="https://wedeploy.com/docs/email/getting-started/">WeDeploy Email</a> to send emails asynchronously.</p>
<p>Basically, we&#39;re trying to combine everything that makes developers productive into one single platform.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking: *&quot;sounds cool, <strong>but how much does it cost?&quot;*</strong></p>
<p>Since we&#39;re still in beta, <strong>everything is free</strong>. Our goal is for you to try it out, so we can get feedback and improve the platform. Once it&#39;s fully stable, we&#39;ll introduce pricing plans, but for <strong>those who join now it will remain free</strong>.</p>
<p>So go ahead, create an account, and <a href="https://console.wedeploy.com">try it out</a>!</p>
<p>We can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;re going to build :)</p>
