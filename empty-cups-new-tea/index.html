        <p>Since I joined GitHub on Sep 14, 2010 I&#39;ve been creating open source projects like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Several of them ended up being very easy to maintain but there are few which requires tons of energy.</p>
<p>Some of those projects are very important to the community and, in the last few months, I didn&#39;t have time enough to take care of them the way they deserve. So I needed to fix that.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>There&#39;s this chinese proverb that says: <em>you need to empty your cup if you want to try new tea</em>. In other words, sometimes you need to stop giving attention to some stuff you did in the past, in order to achieve greater or just new things in the future.</p>
<p>In this mindset, I decided to &quot;recruit&quot; some of the best developers I know to be the official maintainers of these projects. They are going to discuss issues, review pull requests and implement new stuff. And here I am to announce them.</p>
<h2 id="browser-diet"><a href="http://browserdiet.com">Browser Diet</a></h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/browser-diet.jpg" alt="Browser Diet"></p>
<p><a href="http://browserdiet.com">Browser Diet</a> is a very special project for me, perhaps the most important that I led last year. It&#39;s now translated to 7 different languages and has more than 1,000 stars on GitHub which means that lots of people send pull requests and everything.</p>
<p>In order to keep it alive I invited <a href="https://github.com/djalmaaraujo">Djalma Ara√∫jo</a>, a friend who worked with me at Liferay and helps me maintain the <a href="http://customelements.io">CustomElements.io</a> project.
He&#39;s a passionated developer and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll take good care of it.</p>
<h2 id="conf-boilerplate"><a href="http://braziljs.github.io/conf-boilerplate">Conf Boilerplate</a></h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/confb.jpg" alt="Conf Boilerplate"></p>
<p>When I first started this project with <a href="https://github.com/bernarddeluna/">Bernard De Luna</a>, we wanted to provide the easiest experience possible to create amazing conference websites. So we built this boilerplate and after couple months more than 20 events were using it.</p>
<p>We&#39;re very proud that it helped lots of people but there are still lots of things we can implement to make it even better and I&#39;m sure <a href="https://github.com/jcemer">Jean Carlo Emer</a> will handle that.</p>
<h2 id="jquery-boilerplate"><a href="http://jqueryboilerplate.com">jQuery Boilerplate</a></h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/jqbp.jpg" alt="jQuery Boilerplate"></p>
<p>Oh, my first open source experience. <a href="http://jqueryboilerplate.com">jQuery Boilerplate</a> taught so many things, which makes very hard to let it go. However, me and <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/">Addy</a> have been very busy with other projects like Yeoman and WebComponents.org, so we really need help on this.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/heldr">Helder Santana</a>, an extremely good JavaScript engineer, will be the one responsible for that now. He&#39;s a talented guy, just like the others, with very good insights that can take the project to the next level.</p>
<h2 id="braziljs-org"><a href="http://braziljs.org">BrazilJS.org</a></h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/braziljsorg.jpg" alt="BrazilJS.org"></p>
<p>Another project that needs attention is BrazilJS Foundation&#39;s website. Whenever you want to find out about what front-end events will happen in Brazil, that&#39;s the place you go. Not only that, latests news, podcasts and projects are featured there too.</p>
<p>To help the brazilian community even more we invited <a href="https://github.com/diogomoretti">Diogo Moretti</a>. He&#39;s been organizing events and contributing to BrazilJS&#39;s projects for a while. I&#39;m glad we have people like him in the community.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Each one of those guys are developers that I trust and admire. I&#39;m sure they will do a great job and I&#39;m excited to see what&#39;s next for these projects.</p>
<p>The truth is, sometimes you just have to admit that you can&#39;t embrace the world and take care of everything by yourself. The hardest part isn&#39;t decide what to do with your time, but what <strong>not</strong> to do.</p>
