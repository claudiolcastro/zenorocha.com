        <p>Moving to another country means starting a life from zero. I knew that before getting myself into it, but you only realize how hard it is when you actually do it.</p>
<p>Every year I document some of the challenges I faced and lessons I learned along the way (<a href="/2015-01-04-2014-retrospective/">2014</a>, <a href="/o-que-eu-espero-para-2014/">2013</a>, <a href="/my-way/">2012</a>, <a href="/entao-e-natal-e-ano-novo-tambem/">2011</a>).</p>
<p>For this year&#39;s self-centric-review I would like to take a step back and highlight the amazing moments that happened. Make yourself confortable and enjoy the ride!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2015-life">Personal Stuff</h2>

<p>For the last few years I&#39;ve dedicated my life completely to work.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s pretty hard for me to write down that sentence &#39;cause I don&#39;t know if I should feel proud or ashamed of it. The thing is, 2015 was an exception.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January</strong>, started to live together with Carol. The craziest yet most loving little girl in the planet.</li>
<li><strong>March</strong>, moved to US for good. A plan I had for a very long time finally became true.</li>
<li><strong>April</strong>, rented and furnished my entire home for the first time. Thanks IKEA &lt;3</li>
<li><strong>June</strong>, bought my first car. I never liked cars but it&#39;s impossible to not have one in LA.</li>
<li><strong>November</strong>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/662673751373287424">got a dog</a>. Which makes me think: &quot;How could I lived without one for such a long time?&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>These achievements were huge and probably the most important things that happened to me this year. You can even stop reading here, everything described below are just minor stuff ;)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2015-talks">Talks</h2>

<p>As I said before, moving to a new country is not an easy task. That&#39;s why I decided to slow down with that crazy traveling schedule. I learned to say &quot;no&quot; and that&#39;s helping me to enjoy life more ;)</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>My favorite talk this year was at <a href="http://nordicjs.com/">Nordic.js</a> in Stockholm. The event was pretty well organized and I had tons of fun at the <a href="https://twitter.com/nordicjs/status/642021437725913088">ping pong party</a>.</p>
<div class="iframe-wrap">

<p>And the most challenging event was a 40-hour workshop I gave at Fresno&#39;s City College. It was completely energy draining but I learned valuable lessons from students and teachers.</p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2015:</strong> 11 talks and 1 workshop. 7 cities in 4 different countries.</li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> 21 talks and 4 workshops. 18 cities in 8 different countries.</li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> 18 talks and 3 workshops. 12 cities in 3 different countries.</li>
<li><strong>2012:</strong> 24 talks. 13 cities in 3 different countries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2015-blogposts">Blogposts</h2>

<p>2015 was the year of <a href="https://medium.com/@zenorocha">Medium</a> for me. Pretty much everything that I wrote was published there. I&#39;m in love with their platform and I don&#39;t think this is going to change very soon.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>Surprisingly enough, the most impactful piece of text I wrote this year was not in any blog. It was on a <a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/issues/56#issuecomment-144936509">GitHub</a> issue. In the end I replicated that text on Medium as <a href="https://medium.com/@zenorocha/how-did-clipboard-js-get-5000-stars-in-a-few-days-2b2248ba7bd8">&quot;How did clipboard.js get 5000 stars in a few days?&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>However, my favorite one was written couple weeks ago, just before New Year&#39;s. It&#39;s called <a href="https://medium.com/@zenorocha/what-are-you-waiting-for-46037938837a">&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot;</a> and took me months to put that thought on paper.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-post.jpg" alt="Zeno in Yosemite"></p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2015:</strong> 13 posts</li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong> 22 posts</li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> 51 posts</li>
<li><strong>2012:</strong> 49 posts</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="2015-projects">Projects</h2>

<p>My strategy for this year was to <strong>grown instead of create</strong>. What I mean is: instead of building dozens of new small projects I decided to invest more into those project that already cause a big impact and improve them to become even bigger.</p>
<p>That worked pretty well but I just can&#39;t stop creating new things :P</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://customelements.io">CustomElements.io</a></strong>, redesigned in May.</p>
<p>Super proud of what we accomplished not only in terms of UI but also in terms of infrastructure. <em><a href="https://blog.customelements.io/discoverability-for-web-components-72ce29f128b2#.jhli9xh57">Read more about this launch</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-customelements.jpg" alt="CustomElements.io"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://clipboardjs.com">Clipboard.js</a></strong>, launched in September.</p>
<p>By far the most popular project I made this year. Widely praised and adopted by huge players like Bootstrap 4. <em><a href="https://medium.com/@zenorocha/how-did-clipboard-js-get-5000-stars-in-a-few-days-2b2248ba7bd8#.jvdey5bpu">Read more about this launch</a>.</em></p>

<p>A little piece built during Halloween.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/2015-dracula.jpg" alt="Logo: dracula theme"></p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/customelements/www">CustomElements.io</a>: <strong>657</strong> stars on GitHub</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/dracula-theme/">Dracula Theme</a>: <strong>1,510</strong> stars on GitHub</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>Same as last year: <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/502005181161410561">hard work</a>.</p>
<p>I have defined some OKRs for 2016 but those I keep in secret :P All I can tell is that 2015 was incredible and I&#39;m sure 2016 will bring even more exciting stuff. Thank you for reading and being a part of this.</p>
