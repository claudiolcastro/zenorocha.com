          <h1 class="post-title">The technology stack I used to build my first mobile app</h1>
          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Jul 01, 2019</h2>

        <p>In January 2nd, I decided to build my first mobile app just for fun. Three weeks later, the MVP was done and available to users in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-cheese/id1449930676">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lecheese.app">Play Store</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been 6 months since I started that journey and today I decided to share the technology stack that helped me get here.</p>
<h2 id="development-platform">Development Platform</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-dev.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are lots of options to choose in this area. <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> seems great, <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> seems promising, but I decided to use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> for many reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, because it&#39;s JavaScript and you should <a href="http://brendaneich.github.io/ModernWeb.tw-2015/#74">always bet on JS</a>. Instead of learning <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, I can write one code base and compile to native iOS and Android platforms. It uses the same design as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, so it&#39;s easy to build components and manage state.</p>
<p>By using <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a>, the process of building and publishing to the stores is pretty straightforward. And finally, there&#39;s a huge community behind it, which makes it easy to find answers and reuse packages.</p>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-database.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since this is a project that I&#39;m working solo, I need the ability to evolve fast without spending too much time setting up and maintaining complex software. That&#39;s why I went with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>There are two database options within Firebase, you can either use the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database">Realtime Database</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Firestore</a>. I chose Firestore since it&#39;s the evolution of thei Realtime Database. You can <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/rtdb-vs-firestore">read more about the difference between them</a>.</p>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-auth.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are many great services that help with user authentication such as <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, etc. However, I wanted something that could also be integrated with database access rules. That&#39;s why I went with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth">Firebase Authentication</a>.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-storage.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One important piece of the app is the ability to upload pictures from your phone. The natural solution was to use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage">Firebase Storage</a> which was pretty cheap and easy to set up.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-search.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Firebase doesn&#39;t solve all my problems. Full-text search is one of those things that are not covered in their platform.</p>
<p>In order to have this functionality, I decided to use a service called <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> which is focused on search. Every new entry to Firestore triggers a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/search">Cloud Function that updates the Algolia search index</a> and maintains the data in sync.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-ml.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions">Cloud Functions</a>, there are some ML capabilities behind the scenes which are all triggered after an action is made in the app. For example:</p>
<p>Whenever a photo is uploaded, I use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">AutoML Vision</a> to detect text from the image and verify explicit content.</p>
<p>Whenever a review is made, I use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/">AutoML Natural Language</a> to classify entities, get the sentiment, and extract other useful metadata.</p>
<p>Whenever a new cheese is added, I use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/">Text-to-Speech</a> to provide the pronunciation based on its country language.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-other.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I love web development, but since my focus is to find product-market fit for the mobile app, I have very limited time to spend on this area.</p>
<p>To increase my productivity I decided to use <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> to build the API, website, and an admin application to help me review user content.</p>
<h2 id="web-hosting">Web Hosting</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/app-tooling-host.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I&#39;m using Next.js the obvious choice was to host with <a href="https://zeit.co/now">Zeit&#39;s Now</a>. I used that for some time, but after having trouble to migrate from v1 to v2, I decided to move to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Now my billing is centralized in one place which makes things easier too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, I&#39;m using a lot of tools to make the process of building this app easier and more fun.</p>
<p>One important thing to say is that there&#39;s no right or wrong. When it comes to tooling, you have to choose what makes sense to you and your team.</p>
<p>I hope this article can help you choose your own stack for your own apps :)</p>
