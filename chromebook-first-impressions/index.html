        <p><em><a href="http://imasters.com.br/tecnologia/gadgets/chromebook-primeiras-impressoes/">Leia em PortuguÃªs.</a></em></p>
<p>I recently received a special gift for <a href="http://braziljs.org">BrazilJS Foundation</a> from the hands of <a href="http://www.renatomangini.com">Renato Mangini</a>, Developer Relations at Google, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook">Chromebook</a>.</p>
<p>The computer is extremely fast and the operation system is different from all I ever used. So today I&#39;m here to tell my first impressions about it.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>This model is a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-samsung-550.html#ss-550">Samsung Chromebook 550</a>, it doesn&#39;t have the most incredible hardware in the world, just enough to run well and don&#39;t cost too much. You can find it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=2858603011&amp;tag=Registered">Amazon</a> for around $250 to $550. Nowadays there are new models like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebooks.html#pixel">Chromebook Pixel</a>, the newest one.</p>

<h3 id="weight-and-battery">Weight and Battery</h3>
<p>I travel a lot, so when I think about buying a laptop there are two items on my priority list: weight and battery. And this computer do a great job in those aspects, it weights 1.48 kg (3.3 lbs) and lasts over 6 hours of battery.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>The keyboard has some extra buttons that shows how this OS is focusing on web. There are buttons to go back in a browser history, go forward and refresh a page. Besides them, there is search button where we usually see a <em>caps lock</em> button. Touchpad doesnt&#39;t present nothing new.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/chromebook-keyboard.jpg" alt="Chromebook - Keyboard"></p>
<h2 id="operation-system">Operation System</h2>
<p>Google developed a specific OS to run on those Chromebook called ChromeOS and now we reach the cool part. Just like Android, the ChromeOS is a operation system based on Linux, really focused on people that uses their computers just for internet access.</p>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>
<p>Once you turn on your computer you realize how booting is extremely fast, around 5 seconds. Then is time to login using your Google Account. As soon as you&#39;re authenticated all your history at Google&#39;s products are imported. Anyone can log in any Chromebook and have access to your entire environment the way it was in the case of breaking, dropping in the river, a car passing over, forgetting on taxi, etc..</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/chromebook-login.jpg" alt="Chromebook - Login"></p>
<h3 id="file-system">File System</h3>
<p>They tried to make things easier on the entire OS and it couldn&#39;t be different for the way you deal with files. To see them you need to open an app called Files, there you can find two folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloads - where is stored all yours downloads through Chrome.</li>
<li>Google Drive - a cloud storage service, like Dropbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s it!</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/chromebook-filesystem.jpg" alt="Chromebook - Filesystem"></p>
<p>The HD has only 16GB, while Google Drive offers 100GB free. A bet that in the future you will not have more files on your machine, everything will be in the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="webapps">WebApps</h3>
<p>In 2012 I decided to experiment all major operation systems. So I migrated from Windows to Linux, where I spent a good time until migrate to MacOSx, my current OS.</p>
<p>The fun thing is that none of them are similar to ChromeOS. Everything revolves around Chrome, there&#39;s no Software, there&#39;s only WebApp. Even to change a configuration system you go to Chrome.</p>
<p>What also impresses is how all Google services are interconnected. If you need to create a document, spreadsheets or presentations, use Google Docs, Sheets or Slides. If you want to listen a music, use Google Play Music. If you need to communicate via chat or video, use Google Talk or Hangout. And so on...</p>
<p>If something is missing just go to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore?hl=pt-br">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/chromebook-webapps.jpg" alt="Chromebook - WebApps"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are a developer you may feel limited by not being able to install and modify settings through the terminal interface, that&#39;s why my tip is to change to <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/poking-around-your-chrome-os-device">Developer Mode</a>, that way you gain root access and can change everything.</p>
<p>Another cool thing is that is very easy to create your own WebApp. Missed something in your operation system? With HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can build it.</p>
<p>This is certainly a visionary product that introduces a paradigm shift regarding how to handle a computer, I&#39;m curious to see how the brazilian market will receive this product in the future.</p>
