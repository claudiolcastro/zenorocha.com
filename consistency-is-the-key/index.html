          <h2 class="post-subtitle">Dec 16, 2019</h2>

        <p>December and January are exciting months. For most people, it&#39;s a time to reflect on what they achieved and to plan what they want next. That&#39;s no different for me.</p>
<p>I started this year thinking about all the flaws I have. The list was big, but one topic that came up constantly was that <strong>I&#39;m a very intense person</strong>. When I have an idea, I stop everything and start executing it as fast as I can.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Creating things makes me happy - it&#39;s part of who I am. But as you know, anything in excess generates side effects. For me, this was affecting my sleep, my diet, and my ability to focus on what really matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was clear that I needed to make some changes, so in January, I decided to pick a theme for my entire year - consistency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always loved to create things for developers; that was my safe zone. But this year, I tried to <a href="/trying-something-new/">challenge myself</a> to create something for the consumer market and <a href="https://lecheese.app">build a native mobile app</a>, something I&#39;ve never done before.</p>
<p>As I said before, I&#39;m an intense person, so in less than three weeks, I already had a MVP launched on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-cheese/id1449930676">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lecheese.app">Play Store</a>. The challenge here was to keep the momentum going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had forced myself to work a few hours every day instead of a few days for long hours. That was really hard, there were some days when I just wanted to keep going, but I reminded myself to stop and go to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result - the app went from 0 to 5,694 downloads (3,313 App Store / 2,380 Play Store). From those downloads, I was able to capture 2,155 registered users. More importantly, I was able to release 76 versions on each platform, an average of 6 releases per month.</p>

<p>This year I completed seven years working at <a href="https://www.liferay.com">Liferay</a>. In tech land, this looks like an eternity, but it feels like it&#39;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>We had so many challenges that I don&#39;t even know where to start, but if I could pick, I&#39;d say that <a href="/discontinuing-wedeploy/">saying goodbye to WeDeploy</a> was the hardest one.</p>
<p>Discontinuing a product that you created is hard, but we knew this was the right thing to do. Once again, consistency is what made things easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This time it was not about consistency in terms of personal habits; it was consistency in terms of decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We knew that DXP Cloud had a much bigger chance to succeed. Looking at the numbers now, I can say it was the best decision we could have made.</p>

<p>People say you should never start a gym membership at the beginning of the year. Well, that&#39;s precisely what I did. The problem is that I always hated gyms, I tried many different times, and sooner or later I just stopped going.</p>
<p>I heard that CrossFit was different, so I decided to give it a try. I also started to run, something I never really liked to do. However, my behavior towards them were completely different than other times. Here&#39;s what changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to go:</strong> I used to go exercise during the night. If I had a more stressful day, the first thing I&#39;d do was skipping workout. Instead, I tried to go at 6 am, before my day started for real. I had no excuse anymore, and that was liberating.</li>
<li><strong>What to expect:</strong> once you start going more often, your instant-gratification mind starts to ask you: <em>&quot;Where&#39;s the result? Where&#39;s the result?&quot;</em>. The thing is, it takes time to see any change in your body. To solve this, I try to shut up my brain and say to myself: <em>&quot;Just trust the process, just trust the process.&quot;</em></li>
<li><strong>What to share:</strong> for months, I didn&#39;t say a thing about my exercise routine. I could feel a complete change in my lifestyle, but I was trying to avoid telling people about that. The reason is that when you externalize a goal, we think we have accomplished already. A few months later, when I noticed that it was already part of my routine, I shared with friends what I was doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result - I went from 185.6 lbs (84.2 kg) body weight to 164.5 lbs (74.6 kg).</p>
<h1 id="your-turn">Your turn</h1>
<p>I hope this article inspired you to focus on consistency, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is a marathon, and the only way to get to the finish line in a healthy and successful way is to be consistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working hard is just one part of the puzzle.</p>
